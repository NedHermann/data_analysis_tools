There are situations in which this is true. Take a lifeboat. No production is possible. There’s a certain amount of water and if I want more, someone else gets less. People sometimes literally eat other people.
In these situations the basic communist rule of “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is pretty popular. No one cares who owns the water or the lifeboat, resources are distributed according to need, tasks according to ability.
But if the lifeboat lands on a deserted island, production is suddenly possible. You don’t have to take stuff from others, or kill them, to survive. Now you have to be pretty radical to insist everything everyone makes is owned in common and must be shared equally. If I make a fishing boat, you get equal time to use it for sport. If you clear land for crops, I can play football there when it’s my turn.
Even the neediest and laziest people on the island will recognize they have more to gain by allowing private ownership and free trade—creating general prosperity—than by insisting on equal shares of everything.",https://www.quora.com/If-communism-did-provide-equality-of-wealth-for-all-had-a-fair-self-governing-system-wherby-all-working-residents-received-as-standard-healthcare-items-of-leasure-etc-surely-this-would-be-desired-over-the-current,2023-02-27T12:48:32Z
Aaron Brown,Former Risk Manager at AQR Capital Management (2007–2017)12h,"If congress passes a bill that restricts the Supreme Court or adds term limits, can’t the supreme court just deem it unconstitutional?","Depending on the restriction that would be very likely (term limits) or very unlikely (changing the size of the Court).
But either way, if it did happen you would have a Constitutional crisis. Suppose the bill said the Supreme Court justices had to be naked in court session. Congress would pass the bill. The Supreme Court would ignore it. Losers in Supreme Court cases would refuse to accept the loss, on the grounds the justices had robes on when they made it.
Government officials ordered to do one thing by Congress but enjoined against it by the Supreme Court, lower court judges hearing cases, the Justice Department and lots of other people would have to decide whether or not to respect the Supreme Court decision. There’s no method in the Constitution to resolve the issue.
My guess is people would decide mainly on the reasonableness of the restriction and how it related to the language of the Constitution. If Congress were clearly in the wrong, or passed some silly measure, people would respect the Court’s judgment. If there were little Constitutional basis for the Court to object, or if it had a split or badly defended opinion, then Congress could win.",https://www.quora.com/If-congress-passes-a-bill-that-restricts-the-Supreme-Court-or-adds-term-limits-can-t-the-supreme-court-just-deem-it-unconstitutional,2023-02-27T12:48:32Z
Aaron Brown,Former Risk Manager at AQR Capital Management (2007–2017)12h,What if a class of numbers existed which had negative absolute values?,"It does.
Let’s think geometrically. Graph the square root function on real numbers. The left side of the Cartesian plane is empty, negative numbers have no real square roots. The right side is double-valued, every positive real number has two square roots, one positive and one negative.
For some purposes we want square roots for negative numbers. We can’t put them in the two-dimensional Cartesian plane, we have to add a third dimension. The negative number square roots for a curve identical to the positive number square roots, but it’s laid on its side.
The absolute value function has a single value for every real number, so it exists only in the top half of the Cartesian plane; just like the square root function exists only in the right half. To fit negative absolute values in we need to introduce a third dimension. Instead of laying it down flat, it will extend to the front and back of the Cartesian plane. A copy of the absolute value function reflected down will be in this plane.
This is not quite the same as the complex numbers. The complex numbers are added to provide square roots to real numbers. All real numbers already have absolute values, these new numbers are added to provide arguments that give negative absolute values.
This is how split-complex numbers work. They’re not as well known as complex numbers, because their use in applied mathematics is much more limited.",https://www.quora.com/What-if-a-class-of-numbers-existed-which-had-negative-absolute-values,2023-02-27T12:48:32Z
Aaron Brown,Former Risk Manager at AQR Capital Management (2007–2017)12h,Why do some liberals and democrats call Florida governor Ron DeSantis a fascist when has proven he is one of the few leaders left in the west that cares about real freedom?,"Most people today use “fascist” to mean any authoritarian measure they dislike. Real fascists were much worse than DeSantis.
DeSantis is authoritarian in the sense that he goes well beyond the traditional powers and concerns of a governor, usually without the backing of legislators or judges. Of course many other governors of both parties do the same thing. Most people use words like “strong” and “effective” when leaders use authoritarian tactics to do what they want, and “fascist” when the same tactics are used for things they dislike.
But real fascists were far more authoritarian than DeSantis, and their ends were far more evil. Moreover there are many details of fascism that have no relation to anything DeSantis has done.",https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-liberals-and-democrats-call-Florida-governor-Ron-DeSantis-a-fascist-when-has-proven-he-is-one-of-the-few-leaders-left-in-the-west-that-cares-about-real-freedom,2023-02-27T12:48:32Z
Aaron Brown,Former Risk Manager at AQR Capital Management (2007–2017)12h,Are there falsified and deliberately misinterpreted data used to convince school children that Darwinian evolution is an established fact and any other explanation of our biological diversity is false?,"Books for school children, especially elementary school, are oversimplified. The ones my kids had in elementary school mentioned mechanisms beyond simple Darwinian/Mendelian theories but did not elaborate on them. Middle-school science textbooks gave more detail, and high-school and AP texts gave more extensive treatments. When children reach an age to be exposed to molecular biology, of course, mechanisms beyond Darwin and Mendel are required. There were readings from Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould.
In general the teachers were often behind the times compared to the texts. Many of them were not biology, or even science, majors in college. If they were, they might have learned a simpler picture than the modern view.
I think it’s fair to say that textbooks were a little timid when venturing beyond Darwin and Mendel. Epigenetics, the importance of genetic drift, punctuated equilibrium and other concepts were taught with a lot of hedging. I suspect this is a result of having to get textbooks past both conservative red state officials and scientists. The idea was to teach enough complexity to reflect our current understanding of evolution, without encouraging the idea that any hypothesis was plausible, including ones that violated central tenets of evolutionary biology.",https://www.quora.com/Are-there-falsified-and-deliberately-misinterpreted-data-used-to-convince-school-children-that-Darwinian-evolution-is-an-established-fact-and-any-other-explanation-of-our-biological-diversity-is-false,2023-02-27T12:48:32Z
Aaron Brown,Former Risk Manager at AQR Capital Management (2007–2017)12h,Will 2nd amendment fanatics destroy the rights of all gun owners by their hard stance on gun ownership?,"Let’s tone this question down a bit. Will people who believe in gun rights make life difficult for people who want government permission to own some guns, but don’t think they have a right to keep and bear arms?
A good example is the history of free speech. Some people thought movie makers had the right to make whatever films they liked, and movie goers had the right to choose which movies to see. But lots of people disagreed and thought the government should force movies to have only government-approved messages like criminals always get caught, any non-heterosexual sex or sex outside of marriage leads to disaster, races should be kept separate, while individual government officials might be evil the overall system always brings justice, US wars are good, socialism is bad.
People who didn’t believe in free speech but didn’t want the official government censorship of movies that existed in other countries created the Hays code which imposed the speech rules the government wanted. Major studios pledged to adhere to it, and few theaters would show unapproved movies.
Free speech advocates opposed the Hays code. Had they been successful, we might have ended up with government censorship that was worse than the Hays code.
Similarly, people who don’t believe in gun rights are often willing to agree to infringe the right to keep and bear arms, as long as the guns they want are safe. If you only want a handgun for home defense, you’re happy to outlaw open and concealed carry, and rifles. If you only use hunting rifles or only shoot skeet, you’re happy to ban handguns. If you like bolt-action rifles, you don’t mind banning AR-15 style weapons or large magazines. If you already own your gun, you may not care about waiting periods or expanded background checks.
It’s conceivable that opposition to these sorts of infringements will incite people who don’t want any guns to repeal the second amendment and ban all civilian ownership of firearms. I don’t think that’s likely, but it’s always a risk that defending a right causes authoritarians to clamp down. Keeping your mouth shut when rights are violated and obeying legitimate and illegitimate rules may be the safest strategy.
But my general feeling is vigorous defense of individual rights is more likely to result in freedom and justice than surrendering rights in return for favors. Once you give up a right, you have no further negotiating power. If you accept that keeping and bearing arms is a privilege granted by government, you can’t complain if it’s taken away tomorrow.",https://www.quora.com/Will-2nd-amendment-fanatics-destroy-the-rights-of-all-gun-owners-by-their-hard-stance-on-gun-ownership,2023-02-27T12:48:32Z
