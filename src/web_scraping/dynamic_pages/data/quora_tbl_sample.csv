1,Aaron Brown,Former Risk Manager at AQR Capital Management (2007–2017),"If communism did provide equality of wealth for all & had a fair self governing system wherby all working residents received as standard healthcare, items of leasure etc surely this would be desired over the current dog eat dog world?","The key to your question is your assertion that the current world is dog-eat-dog—the only way to survive is to take from others. There are situations in which this is true. Take a lifeboat. No production is possible. There’s a certain amount of water and if I want more, someone else gets less. People sometimes literally eat other people. In these situations the basic communist rule of “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is pretty popular. No one cares who owns the water or the lifeboat, resources are distributed according to need, tasks according to ability. But if the lifeboat lands on a deserted island, production is suddenly possible. You don’t have to take stuff from others, or kill them, to survive. Now you have to be pretty radical to insist everything everyone makes is owned in common and must be shared equally. If I make a fishing boat, you get equal time to use it for sport. If you clear land for crops, I can play football there when it’s my turn. Even the neediest and laziest people on the island will recognize they have more to gain by allowing private ownership and free trade—creating general prosperity—than by insisting on equal shares of everything.",2023-02-27T12:48:32Z,12h
2,Aaron Brown,Former Risk Manager at AQR Capital Management (2007–2017),"If congress passes a bill that restricts the Supreme Court or adds term limits, can’t the supreme court just deem it unconstitutional?","Depending on the restriction that would be very likely (term limits) or very unlikely (changing the size of the Court). But either way, if it did happen you would have a Constitutional crisis. Suppose the bill said the Supreme Court justices had to be naked in court session. Congress would pass the bill. The Supreme Court would ignore it. Losers in Supreme Court cases would refuse to accept the loss, on the grounds the justices had robes on when they made it. Government officials ordered to do one thing by Congress but enjoined against it by the Supreme Court, lower court judges hearing cases, the Justice Department and lots of other people would have to decide whether or not to respect the Supreme Court decision. There’s no method in the Constitution to resolve the issue. My guess is people would decide mainly on the reasonableness of the restriction and how it related to the language of the Constitution. If Congress were clearly in the wrong, or passed some silly measure, people would respect the Court’s judgment. If there were little Constitutional basis for the Court to object, or if it had a split or badly defended opinion, then Congress could win.",2023-02-27T12:48:32Z,12h
3,Aaron Brown,Former Risk Manager at AQR Capital Management (2007–2017),What if a class of numbers existed which had negative absolute values?,"It does. Let’s think geometrically. Graph the square root function on real numbers. The left side of the Cartesian plane is empty, negative numbers have no real square roots. The right side is double-valued, every positive real number has two square roots, one positive and one negative. For some purposes we want square roots for negative numbers. We can’t put them in the two-dimensional Cartesian plane, we have to add a third dimension. The negative number square roots for a curve identical to the positive number square roots, but it’s laid on its side. The absolute value function has a single value for every real number, so it exists only in the top half of the Cartesian plane; just like the square root function exists only in the right half. To fit negative absolute values in we need to introduce a third dimension. Instead of laying it down flat, it will extend to the front and back of the Cartesian plane. A copy of the absolute value function reflected down will be in this plane. This is not quite the same as the complex numbers. The complex numbers are added to provide square roots to real numbers. All real numbers already have absolute values, these new numbers are added to provide arguments that give negative absolute values. This is how split-complex numbers work. They’re not as well known as complex numbers, because their use in applied mathematics is much more limited.",2023-02-27T12:48:32Z,12h
4,Aaron Brown,Former Risk Manager at AQR Capital Management (2007–2017),Why do some liberals and democrats call Florida governor Ron DeSantis a fascist when has proven he is one of the few leaders left in the west that cares about real freedom?,"Most people today use “fascist” to mean any authoritarian measure they dislike. Real fascists were much worse than DeSantis. DeSantis is authoritarian in the sense that he goes well beyond the traditional powers and concerns of a governor, usually without the backing of legislators or judges. Of course many other governors of both parties do the same thing. Most people use words like “strong” and “effective” when leaders use authoritarian tactics to do what they want, and “fascist” when the same tactics are used for things they dislike. But real fascists were far more authoritarian than DeSantis, and their ends were far more evil. Moreover there are many details of fascism that have no relation to anything DeSantis has done.",2023-02-27T12:48:32Z,12h
5,Aaron Brown,Former Risk Manager at AQR Capital Management (2007–2017),Are there falsified and deliberately misinterpreted data used to convince school children that Darwinian evolution is an established fact and any other explanation of our biological diversity is false?,"Books for school children, especially elementary school, are oversimplified. The ones my kids had in elementary school mentioned mechanisms beyond simple Darwinian/Mendelian theories but did not elaborate on them. Middle-school science textbooks gave more detail, and high-school and AP texts gave more extensive treatments. When children reach an age to be exposed to molecular biology, of course, mechanisms beyond Darwin and Mendel are required. There were readings from Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould. In general the teachers were often behind the times compared to the texts. Many of them were not biology, or even science, majors in college. If they were, they might have learned a simpler picture than the modern view. I think it’s fair to say that textbooks were a little timid when venturing beyond Darwin and Mendel. Epigenetics, the importance of genetic drift, punctuated equilibrium and other concepts were taught with a lot of hedging. I suspect this is a result of having to get textbooks past both conservative red state officials and scientists. The idea was to teach enough complexity to reflect our current understanding of evolution, without encouraging the idea that any hypothesis was plausible, including ones that violated central tenets of evolutionary biology.",2023-02-27T12:48:32Z,12h
