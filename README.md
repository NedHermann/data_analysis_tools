## DATA ANALYSIS TOOLS & TECHNIQUES 

This repository will cover all data analysis skills I found practically useful on my trading journey. I cover topics like data gathering (web scraping & api queries), data manipulation (tidyverse, data-cleaning, exploratory-data-analysis, visualizations), models (volatility, regressions, random forest, comparing model performance & efficacy, forecast/predictions), and portfolio analytics (back testing, performance metrics, optimizations).

### DIRECTORY:
