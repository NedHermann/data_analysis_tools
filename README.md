## DATA ANALYSIS TOOLS & TECHNIQUES 

This repository will cover all data analysis skills I found useful and implemented in practice to build and execute trading strategies. I cover topics like data gathering (web scraping & api queries), data manipulation (tidyverse & data-cleaning), models (volatility, regressions, random forest, comparing models with error metrics), and portfolio analytics (back testing, performance metrics, optimizations).

### TBD:
- Volatility Models
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Text Mining
- Exporatory Data Analysis
- Back Testing
- Portfolio Analytics

### DIRECTORY:
- Web Scraping
  - Code: [src/web_scraping](src/web_scraping)
  - Description: Different methods of web scraping static and dynamic pages. Demonstrates how to pull the data you want and common things to clean to actually use the data (date, links, etc).
